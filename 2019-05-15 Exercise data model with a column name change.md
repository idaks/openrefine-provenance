## 2019-05-15 Exercise data model with a column name change

### Background
- Over the weekend developed a data model for representing data cleaning workflows (retrospectively).  See [whiteboard-2019-15](https://github.com/tmcphillips/openrefine-provenance/blob/b4db0ff3061455b71b34a112590b336d028569fa/whiteboards/whiteboard-2019-05-15.png).
- Need to exercise the model with simple data cleaning workflows. Can they be represented?
- For these simple workflows need to check if the most obvious provenance queries are supported by the model.
- A data cleaning workflow that consists of just a data import followed by a single column rename is about as simple as it gets.

### Strategies for data model
As the data model was developed a number of problems and strategies to address them emerged:

- **Problem:** Provenance queries need access to previous values of cells buy is too space-expensive to store each state of a data set in its entirety.  **Solution:** Store only new values when they are assigned to cells, and provide views of the full data set at each point in its history.


-   **Problem:**  Provenance queries must be able to access past states of the data set.  **Solution:** Design a model that is add-only.  If all information added to the database is immutable, and never deleted then in principle it may be possible to access previous states of the data set.

- **Problem:**  A data cleaning workflow may work on different parts of a data set concurrently for both conceptual and performance reasons.  The history of operations should be independent for each part worked on separately.  **Solution:**  Associate the cells, columns, and rows of a single data set with one or array; have data cleaning operations work on these arrays; and separately model and record the slicing and fusion of arrays during the workflow.

### Datalog model - Version 1
- The following is an initial data model represented as datalog facts:

    ```prolog
    % a source refers to the data file from which a dataset is imported
    source(source_id, source_uri, source_format).
    
    % a dataset is associated with a data source, import details,
    % and a data array containing the imported data values
    dataset(dataset_id, source_id, import_id, array_id).
    
    % the import includes all data parsing choices made when the dataset was created
    import(import_id, ...).
    
    % an array is a set of columns, rows, and the values in each cell
    array(array_id, dataset_id).
    
    % a column is associated with an array but its schema and position is elsewhere
    column(column_id, array_id).
    
    % a row is associated with an array but iss schema and position is elsewhere
    row(row_id, array_id).
    
    % a cell is a pairing of a column and row of an array
    cell(cell_id, column_id, row_id).
    
    % an array goes through a sequence of states represented as a singly-linked list
    state(state_id, array_id, previous_state_id).
    
    % content gives the value of a cell at a specific state
    content(content_id, cell_id, state_id, value_id).
    
    % a value is stored as text so that the type of columns can change
    % without updating all of the values of its cells
    value(value_id, value_text).
    
    % the type, name, and relative position of a column can vary from state to state
    column_schema(column_schema_id, column_id, state_id, column_type,
                  column_name, previous_column_id).
    
    % the relative position of a row can vary from state to state
    row_position(row_positition_id, row_id, state_id, previous_row_id).
    ```

### Example 1 - Column rename on a small data set

- Data source is a a CSV file named 'biblio.csv' with these contents:

    ```csv
    Book Title,Author,Date
    Against Method,Paul Feyerabend,1975
    Changing Order,H.M. Collins,1985
    Exceeding Our Grasp,P. Kyle Stanford,2006
    ```

- After importing this data the dataset should look like this is OpenRefine:

	|Book Title|Author|Date|
	|--|--|--|
	|Against Method|Paul Feyerabend|1975|
	|Changing Order|H.M. Collins|1985|
	|Exceeding Our Grasp|P. Kyle Stanford|2006|

- And the Datalog representation of the dataset should start as:

    ```prolog
    % source(source_id, source_uri, source_format).
    source(7, 'biblio.csv', 'text/csv').
    
    % dataset(dataset_id, source_id, import_id, array_id).
    dataset(3, 7, 5, 9).
    
    % import(import_id, ...).
    import(5).
    
    % array(array_id, dataset_id).
    array(9, 3).
    
    % column(column_id, array_id).
    column(1, 9).
    column(2, 9).
    column(3, 9).
    
    % row(row_id, array_id).
    row(6, 9).
    row(7, 9).
    row(8, 9).
    
    % cell(cell_id, column_id, row_id).
    cell(1, 1, 6).
    cell(2, 1, 7).
    cell(3, 1, 8).
    cell(4, 2, 6).
    cell(5, 2, 7).
    cell(6, 2, 8).
    cell(7, 3, 6).
    cell(8, 3, 7).
    cell(9, 3, 8).
    
    % state(state_id, array_id, previous_state_id).
    state(17, 9, nil).
    
    % content(content_id, cell_id, state_id, value_id).
    content(11, 1, 17, 21).
    content(12, 2, 17, 22).
    content(13, 3, 17, 23).
    content(14, 4, 17, 24).
    content(15, 5, 17, 25).
    content(16, 6, 17, 26).
    content(17, 7, 17, 27).
    content(18, 8, 17, 28).
    content(19, 9, 17, 29).
    
    % value(value_id, value_text).
    value(21, 'Against Method').
    value(22, 'Changing Order').
    value(23, 'Exceeding our Grasp').
    value(24, 'Paul Feyerabend').
    value(25, 'H.M. Collins').
    value(26, 'P. Kyle Stanford').
    value(27, '1975').
    value(28, '1985').
    value(29, '2006').
    
    % column_schema(column_schema_id, column_id, state_id, column_type, column_name, previous_column_id).
    column_schema(4, 1, 17, 'string', 'Book Title', nil).
    column_schema(5, 2, 17, 'string', 'Author', 1).
    column_schema(6, 3, 17, 'string', 'Data', 2).
    
    % row_position(row_positition_id, row_id, state_id, previous_row_id).
    row_position(31, 6, 17, nil).
    row_position(32, 7, 17, 6).
    row_position(33, 8, 17, 7).
    ```

- Now if the name of the first column is changed from 'Book Title' to 'Title' to give:

	|Title|Author|Date|
	|--|--|--|
	|Against Method|Paul Feyerabend|1975|
	|Changing Order|H.M. Collins|1985|
	|Exceeding Our Grasp|P. Kyle Stanford|2006|

- Updating the datalog representation requires adding only two facts, one representing the new state, and a second representing the updated column schema in that state:

    ```prolog
    % state(state_id, array_id, previous_state_id).
    state(18, 9, 17).
    
    % column_schema(column_schema_id, column_id, state_id, column_type, column_name, previous_column_id).
    column_schema(4, 1, 18, 'string', 'Title', nil).
    ```
- With this representation of it should be possible to write Datalog queries that answer the following questions:

	1. What is the original title of the column named 'Title' in the final data set?
	2. How many times was the column originally named 'Book Title' renamed?
	3. What are all the names that were assigned to the column originally named 'Book Title'?
	4. What are the final names of all columns that were renamed?

- Note that answering these questions with Version 1 of the model depend on assuming that there is only one array associated with a particular data set.  This assumption will be relaxed in future models.
