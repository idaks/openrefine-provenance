# An Investigation of OpenRefine Provenance

## Overview
This repo represents the history and current state of a project to model the data-cleaning history management features of [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org).  The project has three principal aims:

1. Investigate and clearly document the actual data-cleaning history capabilities of OpenRefine.
2. Demonstrate queries of the historical information captured by OpenRefine, focusing primarily on queries that reveal critical elements of the *provenance* of a cleaned data set. 
3. Publish a paper reporting the results of the project, and complement this paper with the means to reproduce the results.

This repo is meant not just to make it possible for others to *reproduce* the results of this project, but also to make it as easy as possible for others to *review* the work.  The repo will include the notes taken while doing the research; definitions of key aspects of the computing environments used to run any software employed to obtain reported results; and the source code for any custom software developed to carry out the project.

The [notes](https://github.com/tmcphillips/openrefine-provenance/tree/master/notes) folder contains the daily records kept throughout the project.
