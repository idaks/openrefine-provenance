## 2019-05-15 Exercise data model with a column name change

### Background
- Over the weekend developed a data model for representing data cleaning workflows (retrospectively).
- Need to exercise the model with simple data cleaning workflows. Can they be represented?
- For these simple workflows need to check if the most obvious provenance queries are supported by the model.
- A data cleaning workflow that consists of just a data import followed by a single column rename is about as simple as it gets.
