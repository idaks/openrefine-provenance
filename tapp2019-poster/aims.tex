\section{Research Aims}

Through this effort we specifically aim to:

\begin{itemize}[label=\raisebox{0.25ex}{\tiny$\bullet$}]

\item Describe the native data and history model of OpenRefine using the concepts and terminologies of the provenance and reproducible-research communities.

\item Discover what kinds of provenance queries can be supported by the OpenRefine data model and operation history.  Demonstrate queries that reveal the detailed provenance of cleaned data sets.

\item Extend the YesWorkflow process, data, and provenance models as needed to represent the kinds of operations, transformations, data structures, data flows, and data dependencies that characterize data cleaning workflows.  Employ YesWorkflow to represent end-to-end workflows carried out using OpenRefine so that they can be visualized readily and queried prospectively.

\item Identify provenance queries important for achieving transparency that apparently \emph{cannot} be satisfied using just the information recorded by OpenRefine.

\item Execute the project in computational environments that can be reproduced reliably across multiple computer systems maintained by different researchers.  Enable other members of the community easily to repeat our experiments and demonstrations, and to reproduce and review our results on their own computers.

\end{itemize}
