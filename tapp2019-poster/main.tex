\section{Tools}

OpenRefine 3.1 distribution installed in a Linux environment.
OpenRefine REST API and Python client library, with custom extensions, for automating operation of OpenRefine
YesWorkflow toolkit for modeling data cleaning workflow and representing OR operation history in queryable form.
XSB Prolog for expressing and performing Datalog-style graph and provenance queries.
GraphViz for rendering visualizations of query results.
GitHub for sharing research artifacts between co-authors and with research community.
Ansible, Vagrant, and Docker for making research environment reproducible across coauthors' computers and for enabling other researchers to repeat our experiments on their own computers.
Whole Tale and MyBinder for enabling others to reproduce our results without installing software on their own computers. 

\section{Example Provenance Questions}

Let's do some \emph{italics} and \texttt{teletype} and \textsf{sans
  serif}. Does it work?
Here's a bit of code, very simple via \verb|some verbatim| in line, or
\begin{verbatim}
.. in some separate verbatim paragraphs ..
Does it work?
   Even indentation should work .. 
\end{verbatim}

\section{Results}

We demonstrate that under certain conditions complete data cleaning workflows carried out within OR can be repeated fully automatically in a different instance of OR.  We shown that this requires using information that is recorded by OR for its undo/redo feature, but that is not exportable from OR via recipes or its native HTTP API.
We show that key queries of the provenance of cleaned data sets, and of particular columns, rows, and cells in the final data set, can be satisfied using the information captured by OR for its undo/redo feature.
Will illustrate the usefulness of YesWorkflow-style workflow diagrams for making data cleaning workflows transparent and easy to review, and for rendering portions of the overall workflow to represent the result of provenance queries.
