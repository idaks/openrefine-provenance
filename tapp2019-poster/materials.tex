\section{Research tools employed}

We carry out the research reported here using the following tools. We run OpenRefine version 3.1 in Java 8 runtime environments running on multiple platforms. For automating operations with OpenRefine we access the OpenRefine HTTP API by using and extending the Python client library XXX.  We use the YesWorkflow toolkit for modeling data cleaning workflows and representing OpenRefine operation histories in queryable form. We employ XSB Prolog for expressing and performing Datalog-style graph and provenance queries, and GraphViz for rendering visualizations of query results. We use GitHub to share research artifacts between coauthors and with the research community. We depend on Ansible, Vagrant, and Docker for making research environments reproducible across coauthors' computers and for enabling other researchers to repeat our experiments on their own computers. Finally we share preconfigured environments for reproducing our results using resources provided by Whole Tale and MyBinder.
