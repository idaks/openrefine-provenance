\section{Tools}

We use the following tools. We run OpenRefine version 3.1 \cite{OpenRefine} in Java 8 environments on multiple platforms. We access the OpenRefine HTTP API by using and extending the OpenRefine Python Client Library \cite{makepeace18ORclient}. We use the YesWorkflow toolkit for modeling data cleaning workflows and representing OpenRefine operation histories in queryable form. We employ XSB Prolog for expressing and performing Datalog-style graph and provenance queries, and GraphViz for rendering visualizations of query results. We use GitHub to share research artifacts between coauthors and with the community. We depend on Ansible, Vagrant, and Docker for making research environments reproducible across coauthors' computers and for enabling other researchers to repeat our experiments on their own systems. Finally, we share preconfigured computing environments for reproducing our results using resources provided by the Whole Tale and MyBinder projects.
