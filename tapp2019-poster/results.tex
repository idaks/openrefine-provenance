\section{Results}

Code and other artifacts in the GitHub repository accompanying this poster demonstrate the progress we are making towards transparent and reproducible data cleaning workflows. Manually performed data cleaning workflows later can be repeated automatically in different instances of OpenRefine on the same or different data sets using information gathered by OpenRefine but not easily exported as recipes. Key queries of the provenance of cleaned data sets--and of particular columns, rows, cells, and values in a final data set--also can be satisfied using information captured by OpenRefine to support its builtin undo/redo feature. YesWorkflow-style workflow diagrams make full data cleaning workflows transparent and easy to review. Moreover, it is useful to represent the results of key provenance queries by rendering select portions of the overall workflow.
