Code in the GitHub repository accompanying this poster demonstrates advantages of exploiting the full OpenRefine operation history for achieving research transparency and reproducibility. By these means, a manually performed data cleaning workflow can be repeated automatically in a different instance of OpenRefine on the same or different data set. Key queries of the provenance of cleaned data sets, and of particular columns, rows, and cells in the final data set, can be satisfied using the information captured by OR for its undo/redo feature.  YesWorkflow-style workflow diagrams make data cleaning workflows transparent and easy to review.  It is useful to represent the results of key provenance queries by rendering select portions of the overall workflow.
